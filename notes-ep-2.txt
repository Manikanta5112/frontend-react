package.json = is a configuration for npm

to generate it - npm init

webpack, parcel, wheat (called bundlers) (create-react-app behind see uses)

these are algorithm to bundles 

what these bundlers do:
    - chunking
    - minification
    - and more to optimize the code, so that it is ready to move production


npm install -D parcel (-D - want as a dev dependency)
    - two types of dev and normal dependency
    - dev: generally required for development

 "parcel": "^2.12.0" - ^ called caret (automatically upgraded to new version when there is a minor upgrade 2.8.4)
 "parcel": "~2.12.0" - ^ called caret (automatically upgraded to new version when there is a major upgrade 3.0.0)

package-lock.json = will have a exact version like 2.12.0

transitive dependencies = nested dependencies

npx parcel index.html (npx parcle html_name) (inside it builds index.html and host it server)

    - npx: execute a package

npm install react
npm install react-dom or npm i react-dom

To create a prod build
- npx parcel build index.html
- Initially when you run
    - you will get an error because here starting you are mentioning index.html
      where as in package.json you have specified starting as main.js ("main": "App.js",)
      so, after removing it will resolve our issue
